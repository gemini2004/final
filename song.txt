You gotta go and get
Angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time could someone call the referee
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
 
I know you know that I
made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice I mean
Maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me oh let me
Redeem oh redeem oh my self tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
